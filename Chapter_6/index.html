          This is a table describing my progress in taking the CSS test on &copy; <a href="https://sitthetest.com/sitthetest/css-core">Sitthetest.com</a>.
          So far I'm doing okay but I should be doing better than I am right now. I basically told everyone that I'm scoring around 65-70% when the reality is that I've been scoring around 56%, and that's with having gone through the test a bunch of times!
          The thing is I'm very easily distracted and I've basically wasted an entire week fucking around on my phone and breaking it and now I have to pay the price for it. I mean, it's not that much of a price anyways.
          I had no real clue what I was going to do with that money. Anyways, I should end this because this is going on forever and I schould be doing some real coding or scripting or whatever the fuck it is that I'm doing now. Shit, I'm not even getting paid for this!
